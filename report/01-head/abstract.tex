In the scope of this deepening project, and as the technology of NLP is in constant evolution, we will be focusing on the exploration of the word embedding algorithm Word2Vec, which is, at the beginning of 2019, commonly used as a fondation for Deep Neural Network Chatbots. As a result to this project, the student is demonstrating what is the Word2Vec technology, its extensions, and its applications.
